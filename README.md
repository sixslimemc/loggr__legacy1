# Overview
Loggr provides exactly 3 things:
- A public function to create log entries.
- A public hook to implement logging behavior.
- A set of logging conventions.

It does **not** provide any logging behavior implementation.

# Usage

### Log Format

Loggr defines a 'log entry' as an object with the following keys:
| NBT path | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `message` | any | The information carried by this log entry. |
| `source` | string | The datapack namespace this log entry originated from. |
| `level` | int (`0..3`) | The level of this log entry. |
| `time` | int | The gametime when this log entry was created. |
| `subtick_order` | int | The chronological ordering of this entry compared to other log entries created on the same tick (starting at 1).|

Log levels have the following meanings:
| Level | Category | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `0` | Active Debug | Debug message; Should only be utilized during active development. |
| `1` | Admin/Critical | Critical information/error that would be important for an admin to see. |
| `2` | Warning | Non-critical error or warning. |
| `3` | Information | General useful information. |

When creating log entries, they must adhere to this format.

### Logging Messages
Loggr provides the function `loggr:api/log`, which takes the following inputs under the NBT storage location `loggr:in`:
| NBT path | Type | Default Value |
|--|--|--|
| `log.message` | any | *(none)* |
| `log.source` | string | `"DEBUG"` |
| `log.level` | int (`0..3`) | `0` |

This creates and 'sends' a log entry containing **\<message\>**, from the **\<source\>** namespace, with log level **\<level\>**. \
The `time` and `subtick_order` of the log entry are calculated automatically.

It is recommended that **\<message\>** be a structured object, however it is not required to be. \
*This is based in the assumption that logs will be stored and queried.*

### Providing Implementation
When a log entry is sent, it is stored in NBT storage `loggr:hook -> on_log[-1].info.entry` and `#loggr:hook/on_log` is executed. \
To implement behavior, add subscriber function(s) to the `#loggr:hook/on_log` function tag.

*`loggr:hook -> on_log[-1].info.entry` must be treated as read-only.*

## Examples

Basic log usage:
```mcfunction
# 'mypack' just spawned a boss and information about it is already stored in 'mypack:var -> boss.info'.
data merge storage loggr:in {log:{level:3, source:"mypack"}}
data modify storage loggr:in log.message.boss.spawn set from storage mypack:var boss.info
function loggr:api/log
```

Basic implementation:

`<datapack>/data/loggr/tags/function/hook/on_log.json`:
```json
{
    "values": [
        "myimpl:_/my_subscriber"
    ]
}
```
`myimpl:_/my_subscriber`:
```mcfunction
# store log entry in an array
data modify storage myimpl:data all_logs append from storage loggr:hook on_log[-1].info.entry

# send a chat message
tellraw @a "A log entry was created."
```
